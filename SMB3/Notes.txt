Note: The tile set seems to be handled in a weird way depending on whether the level is a main level or sublevel.
For main levels, a 16-bit pointer from $21D87D is read based on the world number, and whatever is used to index levels in the table that's read afterwards. The lower 4 bits read are the tile set.
